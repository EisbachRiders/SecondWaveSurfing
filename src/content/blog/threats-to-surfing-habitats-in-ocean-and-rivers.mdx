description: "Surfing, boating, long walks on the beach or by the lake - yes, we love our oceans, rivers and lakes. And yet we treat them cruelly, even though we need them to survive. They cover more than 70 percent of our planet's surface, and yet the world's waters are under serious threat from plastic waste, overfishing, industrial water pollution to acidification. Discover the biggest issues facing our waters today in our new blog post."

**Our waters on this planet** hold some truly amazing habitats that are worth protecting. However, in today’s world, our surfing habitats are under **constant threat**, endangering the fauna and flora within.

The first step towards **stopping these threats** from having such massive effects is **identifying and educating** ourselves on how we can **help decrease the impact** and protect the ocean and rivers **from environmental destruction**.

# 1. Overfishing and bycatch

The **fishing industry** is one of the **biggest threats** to our oceans, despite the fact that without the oceans and their creatures, it would not even exist. The **demand for fish and seafood** has **increased** so much in recent decades that industrial fishing boats have exploited many habitats and many once common species are threatened with extinction.

**Overfishing** occurs because the **natural fish population cannot regenerate** fast enough to meet overwhelming demand, resulting in **declining fish populations** and **decaying surfing habitats**.

However, fishing nets aren’t just full of the fish they’re targeting – they also often catch any species that get in their way, the so-called **bycatch**. These animals including **dolphins, turtles or sharks** are then thrown back into the sea, **dead or with lethal injuries**.

Scientists have a strategy which will solve this – the creation of **protected zones** in the oceans where **industrial fishing boats can’t go**. However, it may take another few years for these suggested changes to come into effect, which is why currently the **best solution** for us as individual people, surfers and ocean lovers, is to help **lower the demand**.

# 2. Plastic pollution

Our oceans are full of **plastic**, which is **endangering surfing habitats** all around the world. The plastic litter is a **physical danger to sea life**, as animals can get entangled in the plastic pieces leading to injury and death, or ingest the litter, which will block their digestive tracts and lead them to **starve to death**.

Aside from presenting a physical danger to sea life, plastic pollution is also releasing microscopic plastic particles – **microplastics** – into the ocean as it decays. While this is not the only source of microplastics in our oceans, it is one of the **most important**. We still **know very little about microplastics** and their impact on surfing habitats. The **knowledge we do have shows** that **microplastics can bind other harmful toxic substances to them** – an alarming finding to say the least!

As **surfers**, we can do a lot to **help protect marine habitats** from plastic pollution – from **choosing gear made from materials other than plastic** to **picking up any litter we see**, we can truly make a difference in helping protect surfing habitats and preserving them for future generations to enjoy too.

# 3. Rising Temperatures

What’s a small **increase in ocean temperature**, you may be wondering? **Surfing habitats** are diverse yet **sensitive ecosystems** – even a slight change in temperature can destroy them forever.

Firstly, it is predicted that virtually all **coral reefs** will [bleach out by 2100](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/20/world/coral-reefs-2100-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html) unless we can stop climate change. However, the corals themselves aren’t the only organisms in danger. That’s because these coral reefs [are home to 25% of all species in the ocean](https://www.epa.gov/coral-reefs/basic-information-about-coral-reefs)! **Without coral reefs**,  these **species** will also become **extinct**.

# 4. Acidification

Another consequence of our **ever-increasing carbon footprint** – namely the **burning of fossil fuels** - contributes to the **increasing acidification of the oceans**. This is another factor that **leads to the bleaching of coral reefs**, but also has other consequences. 

Among those is the **devastating impact** on **shell-building species**, which form their skeletons with calcium and carbonate from seawater. Putting the chemistry of the matter aside, ocean acidification is inhibiting this ability as it decreases the amount of carbonate ions available in the water. **Shells** may even begin to **fall apart** as a consequence of this.

In addition, **ocean acidification** can also **alter fish behaviour**, such as affecting their **ability to detect** nearby **predators or seek shelter**.

# 5. Water pollution from industries

It’s probably **no surprise** to you that many **industries** are **damaging surfing ecosystems** by releasing pollutants into the environment. While there are many different industries to talk about, let’s highlight three: **fashion, the oil industry and agriculture**.

**Fashion**, especially fast fashion, **releases toxic dyes** from factories. Why? Because it is **perfectly legal** in the **countries where most fast fashion sweatshops are located**. Grey water contaminated with toxic pollutants can be flushed directly into rivers without the threat of sanctions.

It’s no news that the **oil industry** is damaging the ocean – you’ve likely heard about **oil spills** which have **destroyed entire ecosystems**, including sea birds.

Finally, we must not forget the **impact** of the **production of our food**. As shops are expected to offer ever lower prices, **farms** use large amounts of **fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides** to increase their yields. These harsh chemicals are then **washed** into the **rivers and the sea** with the rain, polluting them for years to come.

## The take-away

With all this tough stuff, you might be asking yourself, what can I do as an individual against all these threats?  It's not easy and it starts with changing your habits. Make sure you don't use plastic next time you go shopping (yes, it's not easy), find out if there are sustainable alternatives, reduce your fish consumption, only buy products from companies that respect nature and and so on and so forth.
