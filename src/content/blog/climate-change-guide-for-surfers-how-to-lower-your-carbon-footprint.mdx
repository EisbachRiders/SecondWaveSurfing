In the world of the 21st century, it seems like everything we do can have a negative impact on the environment. As climate change becomes an increasingly serious threat, figuring out how to live a more sustainable lifestyle and not knowing how to reduce your carbon footprint becomes a problem for many.

Thankfully, it’s all much less grim than it sounds. Yes, many of the actions we take can have a negative environmental impact – but with just a little bit of knowledge about how to mitigate it, we can make a positive difference in the world and reduce our carbon footprint.

Today, we’ll focus on what we know best: **surfing**. We’ll share how exactly surfers are frequently contributing to climate change, as well as how you can reduce your carbon footprint in this domain.

# Surfboard manufacturing

Most surfboards made nowadays are made from polyurethane and wrapped in several layers of polyester resin. Both of these are petroleum-based plastics, which means that crude oil needs to be extracted in order for them to be made.

Fossil fuels such as crude oil aren’t just problematic when they’re burned – they also relate to many environmental issues during the extraction process. Putting oil spills, environmental degradation and many ethical issues aside, the process also [releases methane](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/homing-methane-emissions-oil-and-gas-industry) into the atmosphere: a greenhouse gas [84 times more potent than CO2](https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas) in the short run.

Many other factors add to the carbon footprint of surfboards – these include, for example, the electricity needed in manufacturing (when it comes from non-renewable sources). Altogether, producing a new surfboard adds [270 kilograms of CO2](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/17/toxic-truths-at-the-heart-of-surfing) to the atmosphere.

### What’s the solution?

How do you make a more conscious decision and reduce the environmental impact of your surfboard?

Thankfully, there are some more eco-friendly surfboards on the market with a much lower carbon footprint, such as [Wau Surfboards](https://www.wau-surfboards.de/materials/) from Munich. The offering ranges from surfboards made from recycled materials, through those using natural resins from plant-based sources, all the way to recent innovations such as algae or mushroom-based boards. If you want to go back to the roots, you could also give wooden or cork surfboards a try!

Alternatively, if you’re on a budget, you could always give a **[secondhand surfboard](https://secondwavesurfing.com/blog/where-to-find-used-surfboards/)** a try. This way, the need for manufacturing of a new product is completely eliminated and you’re just reusing what already exists and preventing it from being thrown away!

# The impact of your neoprene wetsuit

The typical wetsuit you’ll buy at a store nowadays is made from synthetic rubber which, similarly to the plastics used in the case of surfboards, is made from non-renewable resources. Their extraction also releases methane into the atmosphere and strips Earth of its natural riches.

/>

Once the wetsuit is disposed of, it will most likely go to the landfill and pollute the environment for hundreds of years. If it ends up in the ocean due to poorly managed landfills or irresponsible waste management in your area, its impacts could go even further, not just polluting the waters but also endangering marine life.

### What’s the solution?

As with surfboards, there are lower carbon footprint alternatives available for surfers when it comes to wetsuits. Some brands use recycled neoprene, to eliminate the need for manufacturing and the carbon footprint that process results in. Companies such as [Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/our-footprint/yulex.html) go even further and produce wetsuits from plant-based materials, such as Yulex!

# Reduce the carbon footprint of bags and leashes

This may seem like a small drop in the ocean – but if you’re looking to reduce your carbon footprint as a surfer, don’t just consider the surfboard and wetsuit. Think about the impact of any additional accessories you’re using, such as fins, leashes or bags.

As with the previous items we mentioned, these are most often made from synthetic materials based on fossil fuels. The impact on the environment is therefore very similar: methane released during extraction, fossil fuels burned in manufacturing, toxic chemicals released after disposal and more.

### What’s the solution?

To reduce your contribution to climate change, opt for natural fibres such as bamboo, organic cotton or hemp over synthetics. These, as they’re made from plants, don’t have a crude oil basis, which significantly reduces their carbon footprint. Furtermore, you can pick product which are made of **recycled raw materials**, such as the [Eisbach Riders Quick Lock Touring Fin](https://secondwavesurfing.com/blog/eisbach-riders-a-touring-fin-made-of-recycled-waste-material-for-stand-up-paddling-with-the-quick-lock-system/).

# Choose organic wax

Many conventional surfboard waxes are made from paraffin – a petroleum-based material. This means that the issues related to fossil fuel extraction also apply to waxes. Additionally, paraffin releases toxic compounds into the water as the wax rubs off into the water, some of which have been marked as [probable carcinogens](https://essentials.banyantree.com/blogs/blog/no-love-for-paraffin-wax).

These compounds released into the environment are a threat to marine life, which frequently comes into contact with them. It’s also very difficult to clean up, which is why it’s best to avoid paraffin altogether.

### What’s the solution?

A simple solution to this problem adding to your carbon footprint is using plant-based organic waxes or [beeswax](https://secondwavesurfing.com/blog/product-insights-organic-surf-wax-by-bee-swell/). They have the same effect but don’t affect the environment nearly as much as paraffin! You could even make your own organic surfboard wax at home.

# Reef-friendly sunscreen

Most of the sunscreens you can buy at drugstores nowadays contain [titanium oxide](https://essentials.banyantree.com/blogs/blog/no-love-for-paraffin-wax), which takes a lot of resources to produce (increasing its carbon footprint) and damages the environment.

/>

The majority of sunscreens also contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, which contribute to coral reef bleaching. This is a phenomenon already sped up by climate change, so adding another contributor by freely releasing it into the ocean is not a great idea. These chemicals speed up an effect of climate change, as well as producing more greenhouse gasses in production.

### What’s the solution?

Thankfully, this can be resolved quite easily – all that surfers need to do is switch to more sustainable, reef-friendly sunscreen, such as products from [Suntribe](https://secondwavesurfing.com/shop/product/suntribe-zinc-sun-stick/). Besides the reef-friendly label, which usually means just that there’s no oxybenzone and octinoxate, also check the ingredients to avoid titanium oxide.

# Choose your destinations wisely

Lastly, let’s talk about where you’ll be doing your surfing. This will largely vary depending on where you live – you may have the perfect surfing destination just behind your house, or you may have to travel for miles to get there.

Transportation is a major carbon footprint contributor for surfers. Air travel, in particular, produces more emissions than any other type of travel – a trip from Europe to Australia produces around [4.5 tons of CO2 per person](https://www.theinertia.com/environment/its-time-to-wake-up-to-the-devastating-impact-flying-has-on-the-environment/)!

### What’s the solution?

Always choose your surfing destinations to be as local as possible. If you only live a few minutes from the beach, opt for walking or cycling rather than driving.

However, not all of us are lucky enough to live near a good surfing spot – if you do need to travel, choose public transport whenever you can or carpool with friends.

When flying, there are a few tricks to reduce your carbon footprint. Besides simply picking destinations that are closer to you, you can make a difference by choosing direct flights or opting for economy class. It’s also a good idea to offset your carbon footprint produced by the flight – either directly with the airline, or a carbon offset scheme. In fact, it’s great to do this for any surfing-related carbon emissions you produce!
